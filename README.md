Barebones example of a Flex Mobile project running an Away3D 4.0.0 beta scene in a view navigator application, forked from Jon Rowe a.k.a. zerozero (see [full details](http://artpluscode.com/blog/?p=128)).

This is a modified version which shows a 360Â° video. It requires jonrowe.views.Canvas3D and visuall.ovp.PanoVideoNav in order to work. These can be found in the [Visuall-Interactive/OVP-basic](https://github.com/Visuall-Interactive/OVP-basic) project.

iOS and Android apps can be created owing to Adobe AIR 3.2 (with GPU support).
