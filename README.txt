Barebones example of a Flex Mobile project running an Away3D 4.0.0 beta scene in a view navigator application, forked from Jon Rowe a.k.a. zerozero (full details are here http://artpluscode.com/blog/?p=128).

This is a modified version which shows a 360° video. It requires jonrowe.views.Canvas3D and visuall.ovp.PanoVideoNav in order to work. These can be found in the PanoSphere project.
